#### software also runs on hardware only in that case cannot we consider it also as hardware implementation

You are correct that software runs on hardware, and ultimately, any computation is executed on hardware. However, when we refer to "hardware implementation" in the context of matrix multiplication, we are specifically referring to custom hardware components or specialized hardware accelerators designed specifically for matrix multiplication tasks.

Here's a clarification to differentiate between software and hardware implementations in the context of matrix multiplication:

Software Implementation: In a software implementation, matrix multiplication is executed on general-purpose processors like CPUs or GPUs using software algorithms and libraries. The computations are performed by executing instructions in a sequential manner on the available processing units. While the hardware executes the software code, the focus is primarily on the algorithmic and software aspects rather than the specific hardware design.

Hardware Implementation: In a hardware implementation, custom hardware components or specialized hardware accelerators are designed explicitly for matrix multiplication. These hardware implementations involve designing and fabricating specialized circuits that perform matrix multiplication computations. The hardware is optimized to execute matrix multiplication operations efficiently, often leveraging parallelism, specialized data paths, and optimized memory subsystems.

So, while software ultimately runs on hardware, when discussing hardware implementations of matrix multiplication, we are specifically referring to specialized hardware designed to accelerate matrix multiplication computations. Such hardware implementations offer benefits like improved performance, energy efficiency, and optimized resource utilization specific to matrix multiplication tasks.
